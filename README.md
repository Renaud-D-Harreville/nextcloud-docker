# nextcloud-docker
Nextcloud + OnlyOffice installation with docker and docker compose

Github link : [https://github.com/Renaud-D-Harreville/nextcloud-docker](https://github.com/Renaud-D-Harreville/nextcloud-docker) 


## What this repository will get to you : 
- A secure Nextcloud server with https provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
- [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/) Integration
- [ClamAv antivirus](https://www.clamav.net/) for uploaded files
- A [WebDav](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) example for additional disk
- A simple additional virtual web site (nginx welcome page) to get a minimal example on how to extand your web server.

> Note : This documentation assumes you already have installed docker and docker-compose on your server, and that you have basic knowledges with those tools. 

> It also suppose that you have a valid domain adress, pointing to your (future) web-server. However, you will need this to get automatics SSL certificates delivered by the Let's Encrypt certificate authority.

**This repository is intended to share one possibility to host a complete and secure nextcloud server.**

At first i wanted to get a secure and stable nextcloud self-hosted server, and i forced myself with those constraints :

* Stability and easily management that can be offered by docker containers
* Security of both data and server, mainly served with https protocol (no clear password on the internet).
* Extendable domain sites : Because i didn't want to get my domain to be exclusive for nextcloud, i wanted to add other web sites using my personal domain.
* OnlyOffice integration. We will see that with the first three points, this constraint is easy to get ! (And that was exactly what i wanted to with the 3 first points : easy management, but not to ommit security, and easy extendability !)

# Global overview

### How does this work ? How do we get all those constraints ? 

> Note : This is a general description of the project, I will explain in details each individual step further down the page. 

#### 1) Get a simple docker and docker-compose configuration

First, we want the use of docker because it is more stable, especially when multiple applications are launched on the same server, and it can be very easily managed with docker compose. So we start by searching the rights docker images and if possible some examples of their possible docker compose configuration. [And here we get it !](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud/)

> Note that the docker-compose examples in the link are in version 2, but you will find updated docker-compose files in version 3 in this repository, based on [the nextcloud docker github project](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/tree/master/.examples)

So, this is how we get a nextcloud + mariadb + nginx configuration, that will enable us to get an unsecure but working docker compose nextcloud server, that can be access through the server IP adress. This is approximatively what we can found on the *src/nextcloud directory* (you will see an additional clamav image in it, that i will explain later).

#### 2) Add https protocol for security purpose

But, for security purpose, we want https protocol, and this can be achieved with the letsencrypt docker image. But to make it work we must get a valid domain (you will probably have to buy one), and a correct DNS configuration to map your domain adress to your server IP. More information about this on the [Letsencrypt site web](https://letsencrypt.org/). This is achieved by combining the *src/https-reverse-proxy* and *src/nextcloud* directories. Originally, they were merged into one single directory and one single docker-compose file. But, as we will see, this resulted into the impossibility to add another web site in the same server because port 80 and 443 are already used by the nginx-proxy container !

So, here is what we get after these step :

![Standalone secure nextcloud configuration](resources/standolone-https-nextcloud.png)

#### 3) Refactor all of this to be more extendable.

So, now that we have https enabled, our server is secure. But we want it to be extandable, and by that i mean i want the possibility to add another web site on my server (not just the nextcloud one). So, we have one IP adress, accessible through just one port (443 because we want https for all our web sites !). This is here where we cut in two parts our application : one part for the web back end site (nextcloud application for example), and another part to redirect https requests. This results to the two directories *src/nextcloud* and *src/https-reverse-proxy*. 

And now, here is our configuration by splitting appart https connection with nextcloud server :
![extandable secure nextcloud configuration](resources/nextcloud-reverse-proxy.png)

As you can see on the graph, i put two different sub domain adresses for the nextcloud box and the onlyoffice box. So, here is the trick on how we can have multiple web sites or web services on our server. Nginx-proxy will act as a reverse proxy, and will forward the request to the correct docker container. Here are more explanations on the [nginx-proxy docker image](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy)

Now, we will try to explain more in depth each steps of the configuration :

# Launch the https-reverse-proxy containers

The docker-compose file in the directory in src/https-reverse-proxy contains two images : 
- One for the reverse proxy : jwilder/nginx-proxy
- One for the letsencrypt Certificate Authority : jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion

### Nginx-proxy

The nginx-proxy container will act as a reverse proxy, meaning that he will get all the https requests and deliver them to the proper docker container inside our server. For this to succeed, we will have to correctly configure not the nginx-proxy container, but the futur docker environment variables ! In fact, the nginx-proxy docker will listen to newly created containers (command 'docker run'), and if the environment variable 'VIRTUAL_HOST' is affected inside that container, nginx-proxy will know that this domain adress correspond to that container, so that he can now redirect all the requests from that adress to the newly launched container.
>Note : Note that we have made port 80 accessible even if we only want https... This is because the letsencrypt docker container must be access through that port (http) to validate the domain adress, and then next be capable to deliver a valid certificate. So, keep that port open if you want your https connexion to be functionnal :) 

### Let's Encrypt companion

The Let's Encrypt companion give us the https we need for the security purpose (you don't want your password to be in clear text on the internet...). As for the nginx-proxy, the container will listen to the newly launched containers and retrieve these two environment variable : 
* LETSENCRYPT_HOST : the domain you want to map to your docker container (for example nextcloud.mydomain.com)
* LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL : your email adress.

You can find more informations about [how to configure letsencrpyt here](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion)

In conclusion, you have no configuration to do here, but the next directories must set the 3 environment variable described above to correctly map with those two containers.

to launch the two containers, go to *src/https-reverse-proxy* and use docker-compose to launch the two docker containers :

    cd src/https-reverse-proxy/
    docker-compose up --build -d

Wait a bit for the images to be downloaded and containers creations.

# Launch Nextcloud

Now, we have to configure our Nextcloud server ! 

We will use a MariaDB Database, and the fpm-alpine nextcloud image, (meaning that we have to get a nginx server), and (we just said it) a nginx server. 

> Note that i added an antivirus for scanning all uploaded images. There is no configuration to do on the clamav part, so you can just skip it, it will work by itself. But you will have to configure Nextcloud after to enable antivirus scan ! [See here for more informations (daemon part)](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/admin_manual/configuration_server/antivirus_configuration.html#configuring-clamav-on-nextcloud)

So, let's start with the MariaDB image : 

### Configure MariaDB

Just add strong passwords in the *src/nextcloud/db.env* file for :

    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<root_password>
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=<nextcloud_user_password>

This is all !

### Configure Nextcloud

First, configure the three environment variable in dhe *src/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml* file : 
      
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=<admin_username>
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password>
      - NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS=nextcloud.<mydomain.com>
      
This will create an admin user with the password you set here. You will need it for your first connexion !

The last variable is for alowing requests from your domain adress. If you don't set it, you won't be able to access to your nextcloud server : it will show you that you will have to add that adress in the configuration file.

So, for a rapid configuration, this is it !
If you want to, you can add some more configuration in the src/nextcloud/app/ directory, by following [these instructions](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/13/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html).
You can find a mail configuration example in the directory, and also how to add other trusted domain adresses in the https.config.php file (just uncomment and complete the 'trusted_domains' array).

### Configure nginx server

The Nginx server will serve nextcloud pages. This is here where we have to explicitly explain wich domain adress we want to use for the nextcloud application !
So, just fill these three variable with your domain adress and your email !

      - VIRTUAL_HOST=nextcloud.<mydomain.com>
      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=nextcloud.<mydomain.com>
      - LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=<email>

**IMPORTANT : Be sure you have correctly configure your DNS so that the 'nextcloud.<mydomain.com>' adress point out to your server IP adress ! Let's Encrypt won't be able to deliver you a valid certificate if this is not the case...**

Annd, that's it !! :)

### launch nextcloud application

You now have configured your nextcloud server and can launch it with the same command : 
go to the *src/nextcloud* directory and launch it through :

    cd src/nextcloud/
    docker-compose up --build -d

You will have to wait a bit (maybe minutes) to get your nextcloud avaible, because containers have to wait for each other (nextcloud app must wait MariaDB database for example) to be up ! You can check the logs (docker logs <container_name>) to view if everything is OK !

*You can now go to your web site using nextcloud.mydomain.com adress, and see the nextcloud login page. Congratulation, you now have a nextcloud application :).*

> Note : If you cannot view your site, maybe you have to wait a bit more or you have to check your DNS configuration (that i won't explain here !), make sure you can access to nextcloud.mydomain.com adress by just typing it in your browser adress bar ! (An nginx message must appear !). 

### Configure a bit more your nextcloud

Maybe you will notice that if you go in the settings -> overview page, their is some trouble : 
So, we will fix here two of them about databases indexes and big-int format.
For this, connect yourself to your docker container and execute the two commands : 

    docker exec -it --user www-data nextcloud-app sh
    php occ db:add-missing-indices
    php occ db:convert-filecache-bigint

First line is to connect yourself with the user used by the nextcloud container app. Second line will add missing indices, and final line will supress the warning about bigint file cache problems.

This will supress the corresponding messages (and improve performances on your server..)

# Now, onlyoffice !

Now, we will see how easy it is to add onlyoffice integration with our docker-compose configuration ! Because we have split the nginx-proxy + letsencrpyt container with the nextcloud ones, we can add more and more applications on our server very easily ! 

So, go to the *src/onlyoffice/docker-compose* file, and just add your domain adress and email just as we did it for the previously nextcloud nginx container : 

      - VIRTUAL_HOST=onlyoffice.<mydomain.com>
      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=onlyoffice.<mydomain.com>
      - LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=<email>

> As always, make sure you have configure your DNS to redirect your 'onlyoffice.mydomain.com' adress to your server IP !

Because we want our onlyoffice document server to be secure, you will have to add a secret key too. Create a random one and put it here : 
 
       - JWT_SECRET=<secret_key>

That's it !! :) 

launch your onlyoffice container now ! 

    cd src/onlyoffice/
    docker-compose up --build -d

Et Voila ! :) 

You can now check if your onlyoffice document server is avaible at *onlyoffice.mydomain.com* 
Now, go to your nextcloud web application by going to *nextcloud.mydomain.com* adress, type your login and password you described in the 'Configure Nextcloud' part, and add the onlyoffice integretion app. Configure it on the settings part, and you're done ! :)


# Add a WebDav server

Because maybe for some reasons you want to add additional disk on an external server, one (good) solution is to create a WebDav server in this external server. For example maybe you would like to add a raspberry pi host on your house with some external (eavy) storage connected to it be accessible directly in your nextcloud application. 

So, you will have to create a WebDav server on your remote (your raspberry pi in our example) server. For this, we will still want the first three constraints we forced ourselves to get : docker management, https security and extendability.

Very simple ! :) Now that we have lay the foundation, you can directly re launch the *https-reverse-proxy/docker-compose.yml* file, but now on your remote server : 

    cd src/https-reverse-proxy/
    docker-compose up --build -d
    
This way, we are ready to proxy requests of our futures applications. You will still be able to accept many web applications on your other server ! :) 

Now, go to the *webdav* directory and edit the *docker-compose.yml* file : 

      SERVER_NAMES: webdav.<mydomain.com>
      USERNAME: <random_username>
      PASSWORD: <random_strong_password>
      VIRTUAL_HOST: webdav.<mydomain.com>
      LETSENCRYPT_HOST: webdav.<mydomain.com>
      LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL: <email>
  
You will recognize the three last variable used for the previous containers launched (nginx-proxy and letsencrypt companion).

**Still, make sure your *webdav.mydomain.com* address is correctly configured on your DNS : it has to redirect to your remote server IP !**

Launch your WebDav server : 

    docker-compose up --build -d
    
Check if your server is correclty avaible by going to *webdav.mydomain.com* adress on a web browser. You will be prompted for a user login and password. type them, and check if you can access to your files (certainly empty by the way, but if you don't have any errors, this is certainly all good !)


That's it :)

## Updating the server

To update the server, you just need these two commands : 

    docker-compose build --pull
    docker-compose up -d
